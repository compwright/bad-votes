This is a subjective definition that gives greater leeway to family court judges to take children away from fit, willing, and able parents.
There was a rumor that the Judiciary committee fixed the bill, however they did not. In particular, these issues remain:
- ""making no significant contribution to the child's care and maintenance"" could be exploited in family court by a spouse wishing to gain full custody by characterizing a low-income dad's faithful child support payments to be characterized as ""abandonment"" if the payments do not constitute a satisfactorily large portion of the other parent's expenses.
- ""failing to establish or maintain a substantial and positive relationship with the child"" could be strictly interpreted to include situations where one parent routinely thwarts all attempts of the other parent to communicate with their child, even if such thwarting is in direct violation of court orders. This could be exploited in similar fashion to claim in family court that the other parent abandoned their child in order to gain an advantage over the other parent.
- ""which conduct is sufficient to evince an intent to reject parental responsibilities"" leaves it completely up to the judge.

H 3774,"The ""Human Life Protection Act"" bans certain abortions, with notable exceptions.",-3,,,,,,checked,"The 14th amendment of the US Constitution expressly prohibits states from infringing on rights and liberties afforded to citizens of the United States.

Do citizens of the United States have a God-given, inalienable right to life?

Are unborn children conceived in the United States persons, vested with the rights of a United States citizen?

If so, then you must conclude that this bill violates all three clauses of the 14th amendment in the following ways.

Clause I: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.

- Section 44-41-830(A)(1)(a) allows children conceived in rape or incest to be aborted. These children deserve to have a chance at life, not to be punished with death for the crimes of their fathers.
- Section 44-41-830(A)(1)(b) allows children believed to have fetal anomalies to be aborted. Note that physicians are often wrong in their diagnosis of fetal anomalies. Whether a defect exists or not, the unborn child is still a human person and deserves a chance at life.
- Section 44-41-830(D) allows children to be aborted via contraceptive, provided that the manufacturer's instructions are followed. Note that nearly all contraceptives have secondary abortifacient properties, including hormonal contraceptives. Also note that subsection (3) specifically prohibits mifepristone/misoprostol, but specifically allows ""emergency contraceptives"" which are designed to be taken after conception may have occurred!
- Section 44-41-830(E) allows children conceived via IVF to be ""selectively reduced"" (i.e. culled) if the standards of care for IVF are followed and the physicians make the judgement call that if culling is not done, harm will come to the other unborn children. What makes this so reprehensible is that this is not the normal course of nature! This is a man-made scenario which must be avoided, not accommodated.

Clause II: [No State shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.

- No unborn child has ever committed a crime worthy of death.
- Section 44-41-830 is blatantly unconstitutional by authorizing the killing of the four categories of children listed above, merely on a whim, wish, or judgement call of another person. 

Clause III: [No State shall] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

- Section 44-41-810 defines ""abortion"" as an act ""to terminate the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman with knowledge that [it]... will... cause the death of the unborn human being"" which violates the equal protection clause by setting apart abortion as a different crime from murder (16-3-10, ""killing another person with malice aforethought"").
- Section 44-41-840 states that performing an illegal abortion is a felony, punishable by $10,000 in fines and/or 2 years in jail. This constitutes an absurd ""price"" on the head of each unborn child. In stark contrast, the penalty for murder is 20 years to life, or the death penalty. Note that 16-3-20(C)(a) instructs judges to lean towards severer penalties if the murder victim is dismembered, if the murderer was paid to murder, or if the murder victim is a child under the age of 12.

- Section 44-41-880 allows for a cloak of secrecy to be thrown over one of the party involved in the crime of abortion.

S 474 (Committee),"The committee amendment bans certain abortions, with notable exceptions.",-2,$572500,,,,,checked,"The 14th amendment of the US Constitution expressly prohibits states from infringing on rights and liberties afforded to citizens of the United States.
This bill brings up two central questions: do citizens of the United States have a God-given, inalienable right to life? And, are unborn children conceived in the United States persons, vested with the rights of a United States citizen?
If so, then you must conclude that this bill violates all three clauses of the 14th amendment in the following ways.
Clause I: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.
- Section 44-41-650 allows children conceived in rape or incest to be aborted. These children deserve to have a chance at life, not to be punished with death for the crimes of their fathers.
- Section 44-41-660 allows children believed to have fetal anomalies to be aborted. Note that physicians are often wrong in their diagnosis of fetal anomalies. Whether a defect exists or not, the unborn child is still a human person and deserves a chance at life.
Clause II: [No State shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.
- No unborn child has ever committed a crime worthy of death.
- Sections -650 and -660 is blatantly unconstitutional by authorizing the killing of the categories of children listed above, merely on a whim, wish, or judgement call of another person. 
Clause III: [No State shall] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
- Section 44-41-610 defines ""abortion"" as an act ""to terminate the clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman with knowledge that [it]... will... cause the death of the unborn child"" which violates the equal protection clause by setting apart abortion as a different crime from murder (16-3-10, ""killing another person with malice aforethought"").
- Sections -630, -650, and -660 state that performing an illegal abortion is a felony, punishable by $10,000 in fines and/or 2 years in jail. This constitutes an absurd ""price"" on the head of each unborn child. In stark contrast, the penalty for murder is 20 years to life, or the death penalty. Note that 16-3-20(C)(a) instructs judges to lean towards severer penalties if the murder victim is dismembered, if the murderer was paid to murder, or if the murder victim is a child under the age of 12. Most abortions fit all three of these, and all abortions fit at least one of these aggravating circumstances.
- The amendment repeals the current misdemeanor in 44-41-80(b) for mothers who chemically abort their babies themselves.
- Section 44-41-670 explicitly absolves one of the key parties involved in the commission of a crime of abortion: the mother.

This bill does not state which board member seats will be removed. Since this bill takes effect immediately upon approval by the Governor, unless there happen to already be two vacancies on the board, two board members will have to be removed.

Which ones will they be, and who will decide which ones to remove? There may be an additional constitutionality issue with doing it this way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H 3728,"This bill requires schools to publicly disclose all content taught to students, and attempts to ban the teaching or use of certain concepts from Marxist critical theory in schools.",-2,,checked,"While purporting to ban critical race theory and similar Marxist ideas in schools, this bill actually mandates the teaching of systemic oppression. Section 59-29-620(D) not only acknowledges that systemic racism/sexism/etc. exists, it requires that it be taught in a ""fact""-based way. Key words are “historical oppression of a particular group of people.”

The Senate removed part of 59-29-620(C), which leaves students unprotected from potentially objectionable content that their parents have not given written consent to. In similar fashion, 59-29-650(A)(5) was removed which leaves parents with no ability to contest objectionable content in schools.",checked,"The Senate removed the private cause of action in 59-29-680, which prevents parents from suing a district for breaking this law. The ability to sue the district is probably the only thing that would have a shot at reigning in the leeway that woke groomers have inside of South Carolina schools.

The Senate added 59-29-620(F) which allows teachers to be subjected to mandatory (CRT-based) bias training if the school board votes it in as a disciplinary measure. Note that the words “for prohibited conduct” are not defined.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
